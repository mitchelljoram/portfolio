<strong>Objective: </strong>
For my UBC capstone project, my team cooperated with Motive.io to create an asset distribution and management solution for a platform aimed at 3D interactive assets using a fully featured secure marketplace.
<div my="5"/>
<strong>Solution: </strong>
Our team created a web application which used various technologies such as Typescript, NextJS, ExpressJS, and React for the frontend. For our own API, we utilized NodeJS and Prisma, while for the backend we relied on Postgres and Docker. The application had a marketplace, the ability to upload and download assets, a secure login system, a dashboard, and a role hierarchy system.

<strong>Objective: </strong>
Canpro Baseball is a baseball academy for little league players that relied on its website to promote and recruit teams and players. The website features a roster page and information, league registration, and dynamic schedule using TeamSnap API integration. Unfortunately, their website required maintenance and was not mobile-friendly. I was given this task to complete.

## Workout App - [ Work In Progress ]

<WorkoutCarousel my="10"/>

<strong>Objective: </strong>
As part of my self-improvement journey, I make it a habit to exercise regularly. To keep track of my workouts, I rely on a notes app installed on my Android phone. Unfortunately, there aren't many workout applications that I can find on the Google Play Store. I have made the decision to develop my own application.
<div my="5"/>
<strong>Solution: </strong>
To create the frontend, I am using React Native. This is an ongoing project that is still in progressâ€¦
